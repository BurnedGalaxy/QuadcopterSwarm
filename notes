-> Use clockwise and anticlockwise motors seperately. The nutcap type propellors
are almost always a bad option unless they are from a trusted vendor or the thread
size is long. If the clockwise and anticlockwise propellors are threaded in the
clockwise direction, the countertorque might loosen the clockwise propellors.
(Might be the same reason for my drone accident).

-> Soldering : Tin the wires before soldering. Care must be taken for the heat not
reach upto the electronics through the wire, as it has high thermal capacity. So
selection of Wattage of soldering iron according to the wire gauge is essential.
No need of seperate flux as modern solders come with rosin core. Flux' job is to
remove the oxides.

-> Almost always charge the LiPo batteries in balance mode, because each cells
will charge in a uniform way. Minimum cell voltage is 3v, below that LiPo is not
usable. More about LiPo batteries : https://dronebotworkshop.com/lipo-safety/

-> Better not to place any components under the propellor plane
-> ESCs can cool if they are placed under propellor plane
-> Carbon fibre dusts are itchy
-> Raspberry Pi sensehat can be used to build our own flight controller
-> 12km Airport radius is red zone for flying

-> Accel Calibration: Simple accel should be done only if we are taking copter
after a month of being idle or for big copters which need quick calibration.
For proper calibration simple accel calibration should be avoided
-> Compass Calibration: Compass calibration is best when done away from magnets
and metals.
-> Positive pitch is backwards, so we should reverse the channel 2.
-> Mah decreases over time as it depends on the number of electrolytes, but
voltage is constant as it depends on the battery chemistry
-> Full parameter list in Mission planner contains everything if we want to
modify something.

-> To find the PID values for tuning, we need to know the dynamics of the quadcopter
and should simulate it to get the values. It generally comes with experience.
-> The ideal motor to motor (adjacent) ratio should be 1.2 to 1.5 times the
diameter.
-> Weight/Tmax = 0.5 to 0.7 . Generally we wont go upto 0.7 beacuse it is not
a good value in air noisy environments.
-> Thrust to PWM graph.
-> Theta_c proportional to 4 times del_T. Where Theta_c is the amount pitched,
del_T is the change in Thrust
