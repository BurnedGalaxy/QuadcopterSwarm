-> Use clockwise and anticlockwise motors seperately. The nutcap type propellors
are almost always a bad option unless they are from a trusted vendor or the thread
size is long. If the clockwise and anticlockwise propellors are threaded in the
clockwise direction, the countertorque might loosen the clockwise propellors.
(Might be the same reason for my drone accident).

-> Soldering : Tin the wires before soldering. Care must be taken for the heat not
reach upto the electronics through the wire, as it has high thermal capacity. So
selection of Wattage of soldering iron according to the wire gauge is essential.
No need of seperate flux as modern solders come with rosin core. Flux' job is to
remove the oxides.
