-> Use clockwise and anticlockwise motors seperately. The nutcap type propellors
are almost always a bad option unless they are from a trusted vendor or the thread
size is long. If the clockwise and anticlockwise propellors are threaded in the
clockwise direction, the countertorque might loosen the clockwise propellors.
(Might be the same reason for my drone accident).

-> Soldering : Tin the wires before soldering. Care must be taken for the heat not
reach upto the electronics through the wire, as it has high thermal capacity. So
selection of Wattage of soldering iron according to the wire gauge is essential.
No need of seperate flux as modern solders come with rosin core. Flux' job is to
remove the oxides.

-> Almost always charge the LiPo batteries in balance mode, because each cells
will charge in a uniform way. Minimum cell voltage is 3v, below that LiPo is not
usable. More about LiPo batteries : https://dronebotworkshop.com/lipo-safety/

-> Better not to place any components under the propellor plane
-> ESCs can cool if they are placed under propellor plane
-> Carbon fibre dusts are itchy
